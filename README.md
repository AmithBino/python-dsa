## Introduction

Data structures & algorithms are an essential part of programming. They both fall under the fundamentals of computer science. Understanding these gives us the advantage of writing better and more efficient code in less time. They are key topics when it comes to acing software engineering interview questions, so as developers, we must have knowledge of data Structure and algorithms.
